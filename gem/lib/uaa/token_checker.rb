# This class is for Resource Servers to decode an access token through
# an HTTP endpoint on the Authorization Server.

# Resource servers get tokens and need to validate and decode
# them. This class is for Resource Servers which can accept an opaque
# token from the Authorization Server and can make a call to the
# /check_token endpoint to validate the token.

  # * target - the target base URL of the Authorization Server
  #
  # * resource_id - the id of the Resource Server (known to the
  # Authorization Server), used to validate the tokens and also
  # to authenticate with the /check_token endpoint
  #
  # * secret - the shared secret owned by the Resource Server and used
  # to authenticate with the /check_token endpoint.
