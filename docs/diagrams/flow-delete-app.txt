vmc->cc: delete_app(token, context, name)
note over cc:
    The CC must validate the token and extract
    the userID, then it translates the context
    into an objectID. The CC also defined what
    permission is required to delete an app,
    e.g. 'delete_app'.
end note

    for 'delete_app' for userID or any groupID
end note
