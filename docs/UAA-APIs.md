# User Account and Authentication Service APIs

## Overview

The User Account and Authentication Service (UAA):

* A separate application from the Cloud Controller
* Owns the user accounts and authentication sources
* Called via JSON APIs
* Support for standard protocols to provide single sign-on and delegated authorization to web applications
in addition to JSON APIs to support the Cloud Controller and team features of Cloud Foundry
* Support APIs and a basic login/approval UI for web client apps
* Support APIs for user account management for an external web UI (i.e. `www.cloudfoundry.com`)

(Rather than trigger arguments about how RESTful these APIs are we'll just refer to them as JSON APIs. Most of them are defined by the specs for the OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SCIM standards.)

APIs in this document:

Authentication and Delegated Authorization APIs

* [Get authorization approval or access token: /oauth/authorize](#authorize)
* [Validate access token: /check_token](#check_token)
* [Get access token: /oauth/token](#token)
* [Validate authentication token: /check_id](#check_id)
* [Get user information: /userinfo](#userinfo)
* [Get login information and prompts: /login_info](#login_info)
* [JWT token key for verifying tokens: /token_key](#token_key)
* [Access token admin: `/oauth/(users|clients)/tokens/.*`](#token_admin)
* [Client registration admin: `/oauth/clients/.*`](#client_admin)

User Account APIs

* [Create a user: /User](#createuser)
* [Update a user: /User/{id}](#updateuser)
* [Change password: /User/{id}/password](#changepassword)
* [Query for information about users: /Users](#queryuser)
* [Delete a user: /User/{id}](#deleteuser)

Management information

* [Basic metrics: /varz](#varz)
* [Detailed metrics: /varz/{domain}](#varzdomain)

## Configuration Options

Several modes of operation and other optional features can be set in
configuration files.  Settings for a handful of standard scenarios can
be externalized and switched using environment variables or system
properties.

*  **Internal username/password authentication source**

    The UAA manages a user account database. These accounts can be used for password based authentication similar to existing Cloud Foundry user accounts. The UAA accounts can be configured with password policy such as length, accepted/required character types, expiration times, reset policy, etc.

* **Other Authentication sources**

    External authentication sources can also be built and tested as
    standard alternatives.  The most common and therefore the expected
    starting point are LDAP server, or an external OpenID provider
    (e.g. Google). Another expected authentication source would be Horizon Application Manager either through OAuth2 (preferred), or SAML protocols. General SAML2 support is not currently planned but could be added and would provide capabilities similar to OpenID and OAuth. 

## Authentication and Delegated Authorization API Endpoints

This section deals with machine interactions, not with browsers, although some of them may have browsable content for authenticated users.  All machine requests have accept headers indicating JSON (or a derived media type perhaps).  

The `/userinfo`, `/check_id`, and `/token` endpoints are specified in the [OpenID Connect][] and [OAuth2][] standards and should be used by web applications on a cloud foundry instance such as micro, www, support, but will not be used by flows from vmc.

[OAuth2]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22 "OAuth2, draft 22"
[OpenID Connect]: http://openid.net/openid-connect "OpenID Connect Spec Suite"

## A Note on OAuth Scope

The OAuth2 spec includes a `scope` parameter as part of the token granting request (actually it is a set of scope values).  The spec leaves the business content of the scope up to the participants in the protocol - i.e. the scope values are completely arbitrary and can in principle be chosen by any Resource Server using the tokens.  Clients of the Resource Server have to ask for a valid scope to get a token, but the Authorization Server itself attaches no meaning to the scope - it just passes the value through to the Resource Server.  The UAA implementation of the Authorization Server has a couple of extra scope-related features (by virtue of being implemented in Spring Security where the features originate).

1. There is an optional step in client registration, where a client declares which scopes it will ask for, or alternatively where the Authorization Server can limit the scopes it can ask for. The Authorization Server can then check that token requests contain a valid scope (i.e. one of the set provided on registration).

2. The Resource Servers can each have a unique ID (e.g. a URI). And aother optional part of a client registration is to provide a set of allowed resource ids for the client in question.  The Authorization Server binds the allowed resource ids to the token and then provides the information via the `/check_token` endpoint, so that a Resource Server can check that its own ID is on the allowed list for the token before serving a resource.

Resource IDs have some of the character of a scope, except that the clients themselves don't need to know about them - it is information exchanged between the Authorization and Resource Servers.  The examples in this document use a `scope` parameter that is obvisouly itself a URI, e.g. for a Cloud Controller instance. This is a suggested usage, but whether it is adopted by the real Cloud Controller is not crucial to the system.  Similarly any Resource Server that wants to can check the allowed resource IDs if there are any, but it is not mandatory to do so.

### <a id="authorize"/>OAuth2 Authorization Approval

An [OAuth2][] defined endpoint to provide various tokens and authorization codes.

For the `vmc` flows in this document, we will probably be using the OAuth2 Implicit grant type (to avoid a second round trip to `/token` and so vmc does not need to securely store a refresh token). The authentication method for the user is undefined by OAuth2 but a POST to this endpoint is acceptable, although a GET must also be supported ([see the spec][OAuth2-3.1]).

[OAuth2-3.1]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22#section-3.1

Effectively this means that the endpoint is used to authenticate _and_ obtain an access token in the same request.  Note the correspondence with the UI endpoints (this is similar to the `/login` endpoint with a different representation).

N.B. a GET is used in the [relevant section](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22#section-4.2.1) of the spec that talks about the implicit grant, but a POST is explicitly allowed in the [section on the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint, paragraph 5][OAuth2-3.1].

All requests to this endpoint MUST be over SSL. 

### Implicit Grant

* Request: `POST /oauth/authorize`
* Request Body: some parameters specified by the spec, appended to the query component using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format,

  * `response_type=token`
  * `client_id=vmc`
  * `scope=read write`
  * `redirect_uri` - optional because it can be pre-registered, but a dummy is still needed where vmc is concerned (it doesn't redirect)

  and some required by us for authentication:
  
  * `credentials={"username":"dale","password":"secret"}`
  
  which contains the required information in JSON as returned from the [Login Information Endpoint](#login_info) endpoint, e.g. username/password for internal authentication, or for LDAP, and others as needed for other authentication types

* Response Header: location as defined in the spec includes `access_token` if successful

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: oauth:redirecturi#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&token_type=bearer
		
* Response Codes: 

        302 - Found

### Authorization Code Grant

This is a completely vanilla as per the [OAuth2][] spec, but we give a brief outline here for information purposes

### Browser Initiates

* Request: `GET /oauth/authorize`
* Request Body: some parameters specified by the spec, appended to the query component using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format,

  * `response_type=code`
  * `client_id=www`
  * `scope=read write password`
  * `redirect_uri` is optional because it can be pre-registered

* Request Header:

  * `Cookie: JSESSIONID=ADHGFKHDSJGFGF; Path /` - the authentication
  cookie for the client with UAA.  If there is no cookie user's
  browser is redirected to the `/login`, and will eventually come back
  to `/oauth/authorize`.

* Response Header: location as defined in the spec includes `access_token` if successful

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://www.cloudfoundry.example.com?code=F45jH
		
* Response Codes: 

        302 - Found

### Client Obtains Token

See below for a more detailed description of the [token endpoint](#token).

* Request: the authorization code (form encoded), e.g.

        POST /oauth/token
        code=F45jH

* Response Body:

        {
        "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
        "token_type":"bearer",
        "expires_in":3600,
        }        

* Response Codes:

  * `200 OK`

### <a id="check_token"/>OAuth2 Token Validation Service

An endpoint that allows a resource server such as the cloud controller to validate an access token. Interactions between the resource server and the authorization provider are not specified in OAuth2, so we are adding this endpoint. The request should be over SSL and use basic auth with the shared secret between the UAA and the cloud controller. The POST body should be the access\_token and the response includes the userID, user_name and scope of the token in json format.  The client (not the user) is authenticated via basic auth for this call.

OAuth2 access\_tokens are opaque to clients, but can be decoded by resource servers to obtain all needed information such as userID, scope(s), lifetime, user attributes. If the token is encrypted witha shared sceret between the UAA are resource server it can be decoded without contacting the UAA. However, it may be useful -- at least during development -- for the UAA to specify a short, opaque token and then provide a way for the resource server to return it to the UAA to validate and open. That is what this endpoint does. It does not return general user account information like the /userinfo endpoint, it is specifically to validate and return the information represented by access\_token that the user presented to the resource server.

This endpoint mirrors the OpenID Connect `/check_id` endpoint, so not very RESTful, but we want to make it look and feel like the others. The endpoint is not part of any spec, but it is a useful tool to have for anyone implementing an OAuth2 Resource Server.

* Request: uses basic authorization assuming the caller (a resource server) is actually also a registered client: `base64(resource_server:shared_secret)`

        POST /check_token HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-encoded

        token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL

* Successful Response: 

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
            "id":"4657c1a8-b2d0-4304-b1fe-7bdc203d944f",
            "resource_ids":["openid","cloud_controller"],
            "scope":["read"],
            "email":"marissa@test.org",
            "client_authorities":["ROLE_UNTRUSTED"],
            "expires_in":43173,
            "user_authorities":["ROLE_USER"],
            "user_id":"marissa",
            "client_id":"vmc"
        }
		
    Notes:
  
    * The `user_id` is the same as you get from the (OpenID Connect) `/userinfo` endpoint.  The `id` field is the same as you would use to get the full user profile from `/User`.
  
    * Many of the fields in the response are a courtesy allow the caller to avoid further round trip queries to pick up the same information (e.g. via the `/User` endpoint).  
  
    * The `client_*` data represent the client that the token was granted for, not the caller.  They can be used by the caller, for example, to verify that the client has been granted permission to access a resource.

* Error Responses: see [OAuth2 Error reponses](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22#section-5.2) and this addition:

            HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
            Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
            Cache-Control: no-store
            Pragma: no-cache

            { "error":"invalid_token" }

### <a id="token"/>OAuth2 Token Endpoint

_Not needed for vmc. This endpoint would be used by web flows._

An OAuth2 defined endpoint which accepts authorization code or refresh tokens and provides access\_tokens. The access\_tokens can then be used to gain access to resources within a resource server. 

* Request: `POST /oauth/token`

### <a id="check_id"/>OpenID Check ID Endpoint

_Not needed for vmc. This endpoint might be used by web flows._

An OpenID Connect defined endpoint. It accepts an id_token, which contains claims about the authentication event. It validates the token and returns information contained in the token in JSON format. Basically makes it so that clients do not need to have full token handling implementations.

* Request:

        POST /check_id
		id_token=LKFJHDSG567TDFHG

### <a id="userinfo"/>OpenID User Info Endpoint

_Not needed for vmc. This endpoint would be used by web flows._

An OAuth2 protected resource and an OpenID Connect endpoint. Given an appropriate access\_token, returns information about a user. Defined fields include various standard user profile fields. The response may include other user information such as group membership.

* Request:

        GET /userinfo
		
* Response:

        {
		  "user_id":"olds",
		  "email":"olds@vmare.com"
        }

### <a id="login_info"/>Login Information Endpoint

An endpoint which returns login information, e.g prompts for authorization codes or one-time passwords. This allows vmc to determine what login information it should collect from the user.
	
This call will be unauthenticated.

* Request: `GET /login_info` or `GET /login`
* Request body: _empty_
* Response body: _example_

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json

        "prompt": {
            "email":["text", "validated email address"],
            "password": ["password", "your UAA password" ]
            "otp":["password", "security code"],
        }


## User Account APIs and Endpoints

The plan is to support
[Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM)](http://simplecloud.info) for
these APIs and endpoints.  Authentication is by OAuth2 token, and
access decision is undefined - which users are allowed to do these
operations?  Since this is independent of individual client
applications' access decisions, a simple (role-based) decision based
on local data is adequate.

SCIM has endpoints in /group/* as well which are probably useful (for
the local access decisions in the UAA), but we don't need to support
groups in UAA yet. We might need a pass through based on attributes
from external stores like LDAP (which could be groups).

### <a id="createuser"/>Create a User

See [SCIM - Creating Resources](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-rest-api-01.html#create-resource).

* Request: `POST /User`
* Request Body:

        {
          "schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],
          "userName":"bjensen",
          "name":{
            "formatted":"Ms. Barbara J Jensen III",
            "familyName":"Jensen",
            "givenName":"Barbara"
          }
        }

The `userName` is unique in the UAA, but is allowed to change.  Each user also has a fixed primary key which is a UUID (stored in the `id` field of the core schema).

* Response Body:

        HTTP/1.1 201 Created
        Content-Type: application/json
        Location: https://example.com/v1/User/uid=123456
        ETag: "0"

        {
          "schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],
          "id":"123456",
          "externalId":"bjensen",
          "meta":{
			"version":0,
            "created":"2011-08-01T21:32:44.882Z",
            "lastModified":"2011-08-01T21:32:44.882Z"
          },
          "name":{
            "formatted":"Ms. Barbara J Jensen III",
            "familyName":"Jensen",
            "givenName":"Barbara"
          },
          "userName":"bjensen"
        }

* Response Codes:

        201 - Created successfully
        400 - Bad Request (unparseable, syntactically incorrect etc)
        401 - Unauthorized


### <a id="updateuser"/>Update a User

See [SCIM - Modifying with PUT](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-rest-api-01.html#edit-resource-with-put)

* Request: `PUT /User/:id`
* Request Body:

        Host: example.com
        Accept: application/json
        Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
        If-Match: "2"

        {
          "schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],
          "id":"123456",
          "userName":"bjensen",
          "externalId":"bjensen",
          "name":{
            "formatted":"Ms. Barbara J Jensen III",
            "familyName":"Jensen",
            "givenName":"Barbara",
            "middleName":"Jane"

          },
          "emails":[
            {
                "value":"bjensen@example.com"
            },
            {
                "value":"babs@jensen.org"
            }
          ],
          "meta":{
		    "version":2,
            "created":"2011-11-30T21:11:30.000Z",
            "lastModified":"2011-12-30T21:11:30.000Z"
          }
        }

* Response Body:
        As for create operation, returns the entire, updated record, with the Location header pointing to the resource.

* Response Codes:

        200 - Updated successfully
        400 - Bad Request
        401 - Unauthorized
        404 - Not found

  Note: SCIM also optionally supports partial update using PATCH.

### <a id="changepassword"/>Change Password

See [SCIM - Changing Password](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-rest-api-01.html#change-password)

* Request: `PUT /User/:id/password`
* Request Body:

        Host: example.com
        Accept: application/json
        Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8

        {
          "schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],
          "password": "newpassword"
        }

* Response Body: Empty

* Response Codes:

        204 -Updated successfully
        400 - Bad Request
        401 - Unauthorized
        404 - Not found

  Note: SCIM specifies that a password change is a PATCH, but since this isn't supported by many clients, we have used PUT.  SCIM offers the option to use POST with a header override - if clients want to send `X-HTTP-Method-Override` they can ask us to add support for that.

### <a id="queryuser"/>Query for Information about a User

See [SCIM - List/Query Resources](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-rest-api-01.html#query-resources)

Get information about a user. This is needed by to convert names and email addresses to immutable ids, and immutable ids to display names. The implementation provides the core schema from the specification, but not all attributes are handled in the back end at present (e.g. only one email address per account).

Filters: note that, per the specification, attribute values are comma separated and the filter expressions can be combined with boolean keywords ("or" and "and").

* Request: `GET /Users?attributes=:requestedAttributes&filter=:filter`
* Response Body (for `GET /Users?attributes=id&filter=emails.value eq bjensen@example.com`):

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
          "totalResults":1,
          "schemas":["urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0"],
          "resources":[
            {
              "id":"123456"
            }
          ]
        }


* Response Codes:

        200 - Success
        400 - Bad Request
        401 - Unauthorized

### <a id="deleteuser"/>Delete a User

See [SCIM - Deleting Resources](http://www.simplecloud.info/specs/draft-scim-rest-api-01.html#delete-resource).

* Request: `DELETE /User/:id`
* Request Headers: `If-Match` the `ETag` (version id) for the value to delete
* Request Body: Empty
* Response Body: Empty
* Response Codes: 

        200 - Success
        401 - Unauthorized
        404 - Not found

Deleting accounts is handled in the back end logically using the `active` flag, so to see a list of deleted users you can filter on that attribute (filters by default have it set to true), e.g.

* Request: `GET /Users?attributes=id,userName&filter=userName co 'bjensen' and active eq false`
* Response Body: list of users matching the filter

### <a id="token_key"/>Token Key

An endpoint which returns the JWT token key, used by the UAA to sign JWT access tokens, and to be used by authorized clients to verify that the key came from the UAA.
	
This call is authenticated with client credentials using the HTTP Basic method.

* Request: `GET /token_key`
* Request body: empty
* Response body: _example_

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/plain

        FYSDKJHfgdUydsFJSHDFKAJHDSF

### <a id="token_admin"/>Access Token Admin

OAuth2 proected resources which deal with listing and revoking access tokens.  To revoke a token with `DELETE` clients need to provide a `token_id` (not the token value) which can be obtained from the token list via the corresponding `GET`.  This is to prevent token values from being logged in the server (`DELETE` does not have a body).

### List Tokens for User

* Request: `GET /oauth/users/:username/tokens`
* Access: allowed by clients with `ROLE_ADMIN` and for users to see their own tokens (as long as the client has `ROLE_ADMIN`)
* Request body: empty
* Response body: a list of access tokens, _example_

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/plain

        [
          {
            "access_token": "FYSDKJHfgdUydsFJSHDFKAJHDSF",
            "token_id": "fkjhsdfgksafhdjg",
            "expires_in": 1234,
            "client_id": "vmc"
          }
        ]

### Revoke Token by User

* Request: `DELETE /oauth/users/:username/tokens/:token_id`
* Access: allowed by clients with `ROLE_ADMIN` and for users to revoke their own tokens (as long as the client has `ROLE_ADMIN`)
* Request body: empty
* Reponse code: 204 (NO_CONTENT)
* Response body: empty

        HTTP/1.1 204 NO_CONTENT

### List Tokens for Client

* Request: `GET /oauth/clients/:client_id/tokens`
* Access: allowed by clients with `ROLE_CLIENT`
* Request body: empty
* Response body: a list of access tokens, _example_

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/plain

        [
          {
            "access_token": "KJHDGFKDHSJFUYTGUYGHBKAJHDSF",
            "token_id": "fkjhsdfgksafhdjg",
            "expires_in": 1234,

          }
        ]

### Revoke Token by Client

* Request: `DELETE /oauth/clients/:client_id/tokens/:token_id`
* Access: allowed by clients with `ROLE_CLIENT`
* Request body: empty
* Reponse code: 204 (NO_CONTENT)
* Response body: empty

### <a id="client_admin"/>Client Registration Admin

### Inspect Client

* Request: `GET /oauth/clients/:client_id`
* Access: allowed by clients or users with `ROLE_ADMIN` and `scope=read`
* Request body: client details
* Reponse code: 200 (OK) if successful with client details in JSON response
* Response body: empty

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        {
          client_id : foo,
          scope : [read,write],
          resource_ids : [cloud_controller,scim],
          authorities : [ROLE_CLIENT,ROLE_ADMIN],

* Access: allowed by clients or users with `ROLE_ADMIN` and `scope=write`
* Request body: client details
* Reponse code: 201 (CREATED) if successful
* Response body: empty

        HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
        
Example:

    POST /oauth/clients/foo
    {
      client_id : foo,
      client_secret : fooclientsecret, // optional for untrusted clients
      scope : [read,write],

## UI Endpoints

_N.B. This section contains an initial proposal. These endpoints are not planned for the initial implementation phase._

Web app clients need UI endpoints for the OAuth2 and OpenID redirects. Clients that do not ask for a JSON content type will get HTML.

### Internal Login Form

* Request: `GET /login?error=:error`
* Response Body: form with all the relevant prompts
* Response Codes: 

    200 - Success

### Internal Login

* Request: `POST /login` 
* Request Body: depending on configuration (e.g. do we need OTP / PIN / password etc.)

    username=:username&password=:password...

* Response Header: includes location if redirect, and cookie for subsequent interaction (e.g. authorization)

    Location: http://myapp.cloudfoundry.com/mycoolpage
    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=ldfjhsdhafgkasd

* Response Codes: 

    302 - Found
    200 - Success

### OAuth2 Authorization Confirmation

* Request: `GET /oauth/authorize/confirm`
* Request Body: HTML form posts back to `/oauth/authorize`

    Do you approve the application "foo" to access your CloudFoundry 
    resources with scope "read_cloudfoundry"? Approve/Deny.

* Response Codes: 

    200 - Success

#### OAuth2 Authorization

The precise form of this request is not given by the spec (which just says "obtain authorization"), but the response is.

* Request: `POST /oauth/authorize?user_oauth_approval=true`
* Request Header: needed to ensure the currently authenticated client is the one that is authorizing

    Cookie: JSESSIONID=ldfjhsdhafgkasd

* Response Header: location as defined in the spec (e.g. includes auth code for that grant type, and error information)
* Response Codes: 

    302 - Found

### External Hosted Login Form (OpenID)

* Request: `GET /login`
* Response Header: 

    Location: http://www.google.com/etc/blah
    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=ldfjhsdhafgkasd
    
* Response Codes: 

    302 - Found

## Management Endpoints

### <a id="varz"/>Basic Metrics

Authentication is via HTTP basic using credentials that are configured
via `varz.username` and `varz.password`.  The `/varz` endpoint pulls
data out of the JMX `MBeanServer`, exposing selected nuggets directly
for ease of use, and providing links to more detailed metrics.

* Request: `GET /varz`
* Response Body:

    {
      "type": "UAA",
      "links": {
        "Users": "http://localhost:8080/uaa/varz/Users",

        "user_authentication_failure_count": 0
      },
      "spring.profiles.active": []
    }

### <a id="varzdomain"/>Detailed Metrics

More detailed metrics can be obtained from the links in `/varz`.  All
except the `env` link (the OS env vars) are just the top-level domains
in the JMX `MBeanServer`.  In the case of `Catalina` there are some
known cycles in the object graph which we avoid by restricting the
result to the most interesting areas to do with request processing.

* Request: `GET /varz/{domain}`
* Response Body: (for domain=Catalina)

    {
      "global_request_processor": {
        "http-8080": {
          "processing_time": 0,
          "max_time": 0,
          "request_count": 0,
          "bytes_sent": 0,
          "bytes_received": 0,
          "error_count": 0,
          "modeler_type": "org.apache.coyote.RequestGroupInfo"
        }
      }
    }

Beans from the Spring application context are exposed at
`/varz/spring.application`.
