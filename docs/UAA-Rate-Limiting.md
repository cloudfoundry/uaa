# UAA Rate Limiting (Experimental Feature)
This feature allows operators to set rate limits for UAA endpoints via server configurations. As an experimental
feature, UAA rate limiting's config interface and behaviors are not considered solidified or stable. 
If you opt to be an early adopter of this feature, please pay attention to future changes in this feature 
when you upgrade UAA.

## Enablement
UAA Rate Limiting is enabled by adding a `ratelimit` section to your UAA instance's `uaa.yml` file, which is processed 
upon server startup. If there is an error interpreting the `ratelimit` section, no rate limits will be applied, 
and the error will be logged in server logs and shown by `/RateLimitingStatus` endpoint.

## Configs
Here is a brief example of the `ratelimit` section:
```yaml
ratelimit:
  loggingOption: OnlyLimited
  credentialID: 'JWTjsonField:Payload:email'
  limiterMappings:
    - name: AuthToken
      pathSelectors:
        - "equals:/oauth/token"
      withCallerRemoteAddressID: 50r/s
    - name: SCIM
      withCallerCredentialsID: 2000r/10s
      pathSelectors:
        - "startsWith:/Users"
        - "startsWith:/Groups"
    - name: EverythingElse
      global: 2000r/s
      pathSelectors:
        - "other"
```
The example config above would result in the following:
* Requests to the UAA token endpoint (`/oauth/token`) will be rate-limited to 50 requests per second, 
per originating IP address.
* Requests to the UAA SCIM management endpoints (endpoints that start with `/Groups` or `/Users`) will be rate-limited to 2000 requests per 10 seconds; 
this rate limit is applied to requests with JWTs (SCIM management endpoints require a JWT to access) that have the same `email` field in their payloads.
* Requests to all other UAA endpoints will be rate-limited to 2000 total requests per second; this rate limit is applied globally to the total number of requests issued by any entities.
* Requests that are rate-limited will be logged.

#### NOTES
* For `withCallerCredentialsID` to function, `ratelimit.credentialID` MUST be defined (see `ratelimit` documentation above). And the current "limiterMapping"'s `pathSelectors` MUST only target endpoints that require a Credential ID (aka a token); otherwise, this `withCallerCredentialsID` limit will be ignored.
* `global` limit is more resource-intensive than other limits because it creates more mutual-exclusion contention.

## `/RateLimitingStatus` endpoint
The current status of the Rate limiting is published via the public endpoint `/RateLimitingStatus`. 
This endpoint cannot be configured with a rate limit. This endpoint displays the following information:
- `current.status`: Overall status of UAA rate limiting, with one of the following values:
    - `DISABLED`: No configuration given, rate limiting is off.
    - `ACTIVE`: Configuration successfully parsed and active.
    - `PENDING`: Configuration file could not be read successfully.
- `current.credentialIdExtractor`: Credential ID configuration that is currently used.
- `current.loggingLevel`: loggingOption that is currently used.
- `current.limiterMapping`: Number of limiters from the configuration (aka, size of limiterMappings from config file)
- `fromSource`: Location of the config file that is currently applied

## Error Messages
A request that is denied because of a rate limit will receive the "429 - Too Many Requests" Http Status Code.
In addition, an error message is returned. Depending on whether the request Accepts HTML or JSON as a response, 
the error message is either embedded in an HTML Page or included in a JSON response body as the "error" field.

Beside the static error message: `429 - Too Many Requests - Request limited by Rate Limiter configuration:`
the error also contains information about the rate limiting setting that limited this request.
This includes the name of the limiter as well as information about whether they have hit a "global" rate limit 
or the limit was only applied to their Credential ID or IP address.

## Misc implementation details
This section contains miscellaneous info about the implementation details of this feature.
They are for UAA dev purpose only. 

### Selection of Single or Multiple *limiterMapping*(s)

There are five types of *pathSelector*s which fall into two groups:
- *all*
- non-all (path based)

As both the *all* and the non-all *limiterMapping*(s) are checked, there will likely be **One** OR **Two** *limiterMapping*(s)
selected:
1. from *all* (selected if there is one in the Configuration file)
2. from non-all.

The "non-all" *limiterMapping* selection is the first match found in following order:
1. *equals*     (uses a map to look up the path and is very fast, best option for speed).
2. *startsWith* (uses an ordered list to find the longest matching path, linear search).
3. *contains*   (uses an ordered list to find the longest matching path, linear search).
4. *other*      (obviously if there is no *other*, and none of the above matched, then there will be no "non-all")

### Order of *Window Type* limiter(s) from Multiple *limiterMapping*s

A *Window Type* is one of the following: `withCallerCredentialsID`, `withCallerRemoteAddressID`, `withoutCallerID`, `global`.

If there are more than one *limiterMapping* & *Window Type* combinations, then they (the *InternalLimiter*s)
are added for processing (mutual-exclusion locking) in the following order:
1. "non-global" from the "non-all" if exists
2. "non-global" from the *all* if exists
3. *global* from the "non-all" if exists
4. *global* from the *all* if exists

The reason for the order is two-fold:
1. Since the processing of the *InternalLimiter*(s) stops as soon as one indicates that it is limiting,
   and it was assumed that the "non-global" and/or the "non-all" would have lower limits,
   they should be checked and (possibly) limit sooner!
2. While "non-global" and/or the "non-all" would probably have lower limits,
   they would also individually participate less frequently in each request;
   as such they are expected to have the least mutual-exclusion (lock) contention
   (waiting for lock freeing) so they should be checked first
   and holding the lock a bit longer is not as detrimental as
   holding the lock longer on the others, especially *all*'s *global*!

### Order of *Caller IP* extraction

The caller IP address is extracted from **HttpServletRequest** by checking the following headers and fields of the **HttpServletRequest** in the following order:
1. Header: "X-Client-IP" (whole value)
2. Header: "X-Real-IP" (whole value)
3. Header: "X-Forwarded-For" (first value of comma separated IP addresses)
4. Method: getRemoteAddr()
