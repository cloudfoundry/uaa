# UAA Release Notes Version 1.1.0

Highlights for this release:

* New security model for OAuth2 scope and resource id
(a.k.a. audience).  Scope names are now period-separated and include
the resource id as a prefix, e.g. 'cloud_controller.read' for
read-only access to the cloud controller.  Permitted scopes for a
client now also depend on the grant type - if the token is for a user
the permitted scopes are `client.scope` as before, but if the token is
a `client_credentials` grant then the permitted scopes are the
`client.authorities`.  See
[UAA Security Model](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-Security.md)
docs for more detail.

* Support for groups in user records.  Group values are appended to
the scope of a token acquired on behalf of a user, as long as they are
permitted to the client.

* Password strength endpoint: POST a candidate password value to
`/password/score` with a from parameter called `password` and get
back a JSON response containing `score` and `requiredScore` values . The
required strength score is not yet enforced for new account creation.

* Client web applications can ask for a redirect after logging out of
the UAA
e.g. `/logout.do?redirect=http://myclient.cloudfoundry.com/loggedout`.
This can be used to give a more friendly user experience to
someone logging out of the platform.

* Bootstrap user accounts can be specified in `uaa.yml`.  The format
for a user is
'username|password|email|givenName|familyName(|comma-separated-groups)'
e.g.

    scim:
      users:
        - paul|wombat|paul@test.org|Paul|Smith|uaa.admin
        - stefan|wallaby|stefan@test.org|Stefan|Schmidt

* The database is not used for audit logging any more.  The
`SEC_AUDIT` table is only used for tracking consecutive failed logins,
and all the audit logs go to the normal UAA logger (i.e. syslog in
production) with label 'UAA.audit' (no change).

* [CFID-308](https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/CFID-308) - Use resource_id as a prefix for scopes (e.g. cloud_controller.read)
* [CFID-309](https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/CFID-309) - Harmonize granted authorities and scopes
