User Account and Authentication - A note on Tokens
==================================================

# Overview
The UAA is a web application that manages users and Oauth 2 clients and issues tokens that are used for authorization.
The UAA implements [the Oauth 2 authorization framework](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and issues 
[JSON web tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-25).
There is often a level of confusion of what the UAA does when initially starting to use it.

This document is intended a brief introduction to clear up some concepts for those that are new to
Oauth 2 and/or the UAA.

# Getting Started
Easiest way to explain what a token contains and how it is used is to get you to look at one. 
This step requires that you have Java 1.7 or higher installed.


    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa.git
    cd uaa
    ./gradlew run

You now have a UAA server running. There is a Ruby gem called cf-uaac, that one can use to communicate with the UAA.
But for sake of clarity, we will use ```curl``` commands.

    curl -v -d"username=marissa&password=koala&client_id=app&grant_type=password" -u "app:appclientsecret" http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token

This yields a return token

You can look at the body of the access token using a [decoder](http://jwt.calebb.net/).

    }

Some of these fields are described in the [JSON web tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-25) 
specification. However, the vendor may add additional fields, or attributes, to the token itself.

There are some notable fields here that we are interested in:

  * user_id - a UUID for the user
  * cid/client_id - unique name for the client. Unique to the system it runs on.
  * scope - a list of permissions that this client has on behalf of this user
  * [aud](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-25#section-4.1.3) - the audience, who this token is intended for. 

## Users and Clients and other actors
A user is often represented as a live person, or a process running.

A client is an application that acts on behalf of a user or act on its own.

A resource server is often defined as an application with access to a user's data

A brief and informative [tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/oauth2/index.html) has already been written.

## Grant types
An access token can be requested in four different ways, in the Oauth specification they are referred to as 
[grant types](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-1.3)

  1. client_credentials - no user involved. requesting a token to represent a client only
  2. password - the client uses the user's credentials and passes them to the UAA to generate a token
     This is the method we used in our example.
  3. implicit - this is similar to the password grant, but a client password(secret) is not needed
  4. authorization_code - in this scenario, the client never sees the user's credentials. It is the most secure
     grant type but relies on 302 redirects from the HTTP protocol.

## Scopes
When it comes to the UAA, and integrating with the UAA, you will be dealing with scopes. Scopes are essentially permissions, 
and are added as a [named parameter](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-3.3)
in the [access token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-3.3).

In the Java world, often referred to as roles. Scopes in a token have two different names in the UAA token

  * scope - when the token represents a client acting on behalf of a user
  * authorities - when the token represents the client (application) itself

This is how the permissions are labeled in the token by the UAA. When a resource server receives a request containing a token, 
the server can make a decision based on the scopes in the token. The resource MUST validate the token first, 
there are several ways of doing this discussed in the Oauth 2 specification. 

The resource server must differentiate between a client only token, and read 'authorities', or a client on behalf of user
token to read the 'scope' field.

The name of the scope, such as ```password.write``` are arbitrary strings. They don't mean anything to any component except 
the resource server that uses them for authorization. For example, ```password.write``` is a scope that the must be present
in the token when a request to the UAA is made for a password change. 

Scopes, are arbitrary strings, defined by the client itself. The UAA does use the base name of a scope and adds it to the 
[audience](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-25#section-4.1.3) field. The 'base name' is defined
as anything before the last dot. 

### Client authorities, UAA groups and scopes
In the UAA each client has a list of ```client authorities```. This is ```List<String>``` of scopes
that represents the permissions the client has by itself. The second field the client has is the ```scopes``` field. 
The ```client scopes``` represents the permissions that the client uses when acting on behalf of a user.
 
Authorities are used when we have the ```client_credentials``` grant type

In the UAA, a user belongs to one or more groups. A group in UAA, represents a scope in the Oauth world. Groups can be 
nested allowing easier management of group memberships.

When a token is requested by a client on behalf of a user the following process is followed

  1. The client is authenticated
  2. The user is authenticated
  3. The client scopes are retrieved
  4. The user scopes are retrieved
  5. A scope list is created with the shared scopes from step 3 and 4. 
  6. A token is generated, with the scope parameter from step 5.

### Wildcard scopes
As scopes are arbitrary strings and those strings often containing dots to create a naming conventions.
For example, a resource server maintaining documents could create the following naming scheme

    document.<document id>.read
    document.<document id>.write
    document.<document id>.delete

A client that is accessing the resource server and reading, writing and deleting documents on behalf of a user, can be 
assigned the ```scope=document.*.read document.*.delete```. You can now assign scopes to the user in 
the form of

    document.asdsd-adasda-123212.write
    document.asdsd-adasda-123212.read
    document.wqere-adasda-adasda.read
    document.wqere-adasda-adasda.delete

The token representing the user's permission, would contain 

    document.asdsd-adasda-123212.read
    document.wqere-adasda-adasda.read
    document.wqere-adasda-adasda.delete
since the client does not have the ```write```.
The audience field for the token would be ```document```.

A user may not have a wild card in the scope (group name). In that case, the star, *, does not represent a wildcard,
it's just another character in the arbitrary strings. 
Scope names are [case sensitive](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-3.3).
 
Wild card scopes have been available since [UAA version 1.8.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/releases/tag/1.8.0).

## Token enhancers

```UaaTokenEnhancer``` is an interface which can be used to enhance access and refresh tokens with custom attributes. 
You may plug-in a ```UaaTokenEnhancer``` into the bean ```UaaTokenServices```. Value returned by ```getExternalAttributes``` will be passed to 
```setAdditionalInformation``` of the token object.
